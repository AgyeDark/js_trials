//*Assignment questions covering objects, rest;spread; and ternary operator, map, filter, reduce, for of, for in, functions and this :

//1. Write a function that uses the spread operator to concatenate two arrays.
//2. Create an object called "person" with properties for name, age, and occupation.
const person = {
    name: "Agyei Darko Kelvin",
    age: 32,
    occupation: "civil engineer"
}
//3. Use the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd.
//4. Implement a function that uses the map function to double each element in an array.
//5. Write a function that converts the first letter of an array of words into a uppercase letter and return a new array.
//6. Use the reduce function to find the sum of all elements in an array.
//7. Write a function that uses the rest operator to sum an arbitrary number of arguments.
//8. Implement a function that uses the this keyword to access a property of an object.
//9. Create an object called "car" with properties for make, model, and year.
//10. Use the spread operator to create a copy of an array.
//11. Write a function that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
//12. Implement a function that uses the map function to convert an array of strings to uppercase.
//13. Use the filter function to return only strings that contain a specific substring from an array.
//14. Create a function that uses the reduce function to find the maximum value in an array.
//15. Use the for...in loop to iterate over the keys of an object and print each key.
//16. Write a function that uses the rest operator to concatenate an arbitrary number of strings.
//17. Implement a function that uses the this keyword to call a method of an object.
//18. Create an object called "book" with properties for title, author, and publication year.
//19. Use the spread operator to merge two objects into a new object.
//20. Write a function that uses the ternary operator to check if a string is empty or not.
//21. Implement a function that uses the map function to calculate the square of each element in an array.
//22. Use the filter function to return only numbers that are divisible by a specific value from an array.
//23. Create a function that uses the reduce function to find the average value of an array.
///24. Use the for...of loop to iterate over the words of a string and print each word.
//25. Write a function that uses the rest operator to find the maximum value in an arbitrary number of arguments.
//26. Implement a function that uses the this keyword to update a property of an object.
